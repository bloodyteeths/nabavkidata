# SLIDE 2: The Problem - A €5 Billion Corruption Crisis

## Public Procurement in the Western Balkans is Broken

### The Scale of the Problem:
- **€50+ billion** annual public procurement across Western Balkans + Eastern Europe
- **5-25% lost to corruption** = €2.5-12.5 billion annually (World Bank, OECD estimates)
- **Macedonia alone:** €1.2B procurement, €150-300M estimated annual corruption losses

### Why This Persists:

| Barrier | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Data Silos** | Tender info scattered across 15+ national portals, incompatible formats |
| **Unreadable Documents** | 80%+ are scanned PDFs in Cyrillic - no OCR solution exists |
| **No Pattern Detection** | Bid rigging, collusion rings, and price manipulation invisible |
| **Language Barriers** | Critical documents in 8+ languages, untranslatable at scale |

### Who Suffers:
- **SMEs:** Miss 60%+ of opportunities due to information asymmetry
- **Governments:** Lose billions to undetected fraud
- **Citizens:** Pay for overpriced, low-quality public services
- **EU Integration:** Western Balkans cannot meet Chapter 23 (Judiciary/Anti-Corruption) requirements

**This is not just a business problem - it's a barrier to EU enlargement.**

# SLIDE 10: The Ask - Why EIC, Why Now

## Funding Request: €2.5 Million

### Use of Funds:

| Category | Amount | % | Key Activities |
|----------|--------|---|----------------|
| **R&D - AI/ML** | €1,000,000 | 40% | Corruption detection algorithms, GNN development, OCR improvements |
| **Engineering** | €600,000 | 24% | Platform scaling, multi-country architecture, API development |

| **Operations** | €250,000 | 10% | Legal, compliance, office, infrastructure |
| **Reserve** | €150,000 | 6% | Contingency for unforeseen challenges |

### Why EIC Accelerator (Not Private Investment):

1. **Deep Tech Risk:** Corruption detection AI is unproven at scale - VCs want proven unit economics
2. **Market Timing:** 3-5 year horizon to EU enlargement; too long for typical VC patience
3. **Public Good Component:** Transparency features reduce commercial attractiveness but maximize societal impact
4. **Regional Focus:** Western Balkans is "off the radar" for mainstream European VCs
5. **Strategic Alignment:** EIC specifically funds EU enlargement-enabling technologies

### Grant vs. Equity Preference:
- **Preferred:** Blended finance (grant + equity)
- **Grant portion:** R&D and deep tech development
- **Equity portion:** Go-to-market and scaling activities
