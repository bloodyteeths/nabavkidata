## 0:00 - 0:25 | THE HOOK: Why This Matters to Europe

**[VISUAL: EU map with Western Balkans highlighted, news headlines about corruption, EU enlargement summit footage]**

**SPEAKER (Founder/CEO, on camera):**

"The European Union has invested six billion euros in bringing the Western Balkans into Europe. But there's a problem no one can solve:

Five billion euros disappear every year to procurement corruption in this region. Hidden in scanned documents. Buried in Cyrillic text. Invisible to everyone.

Businesses can't compete fairly. Citizens can't see where their money goes. And EU candidate countries can't meet Chapter 23 requirements for membership.

We built the technology to change this."

## 0:25 - 1:00 | THE SOLUTION: Show, Don't Tell

**[VISUAL: Platform demo - search interface, results appearing, dashboards]**

**SPEAKER:**

"This is NabavkiData - AI-powered procurement intelligence.

**[VISUAL: User typing "road construction over 100,000 euros single bidder"]**

Watch: A company searches for road contracts with only one bidder - a classic corruption red flag. Instantly, we surface every suspicious tender from the past 16 years.

**[VISUAL: OCR processing scanned Cyrillic document]**

Here's our breakthrough: We read what no one else can. Our custom OCR pipeline achieves 94% accuracy on degraded Cyrillic scans - double what Google or Amazon can do.

**[VISUAL: Entity network visualization, risk scores appearing]**

We don't just find documents. We find patterns. Which companies always bid together. Which contracts have suspicious pricing. Which officials favor certain vendors.

Our system has already processed 7,800 awarded tenders, 194,000 bidder records, and 450,000 document embeddings. The data exists. Now it speaks."

## 1:00 - 1:35 | THE TECHNOLOGY: Deep Tech Credibility

**[VISUAL: Animated tech stack diagram, TRL ladder showing progress]**

**SPEAKER:**

"This isn't a prototype - it's operational technology at TRL 7.

Our stack combines three innovations:

**[VISUAL: Icon animations for each]**

First, intelligent scrapers that harvest data from government portals in real-time.

Second, a Cyrillic OCR pipeline trained on two years of government documents - our moat.

Third, a RAG-based AI system that understands meaning, not just keywords. Ask it anything in any language.

And now, we're building something unprecedented: machine learning models that detect corruption automatically. Anomaly detection for pricing fraud. Graph neural networks that unmask collusion rings.

This is the anti-corruption intelligence the EU needs to bring the Western Balkans into Europe."

## 1:35 - 2:10 | MARKET & TRACTION: Proof It Works

**[VISUAL: Market size graphics, platform metrics, logos of interested organizations]**

**SPEAKER:**

"Our market is massive and underserved.

50 billion euros in annual procurement across the Western Balkans. 500,000 companies competing for contracts. Zero solutions that can read their documents.

**[VISUAL: Map showing expansion path - Macedonia → Kosovo → Albania → Serbia]**

We've proven the model in Macedonia. Now we're ready to expand across the region.

We already have letters of intent from anti-corruption NGOs, construction companies, and investigative journalists. Transparency International and BIRN, the Balkan investigative network, are in discussions.

This isn't theory. The platform is live. The data is flowing. Customers are waiting."

---

## 2:10 - 2:45 | THE ASK: Why EIC

**[VISUAL: EIC logo, funding breakdown, team photos]**

**SPEAKER:**

"We're requesting 2.5 million euros from the EIC Accelerator.

Why EIC and not private VCs?

Because this is deep tech with a public mission. Corruption detection AI is unproven. The Western Balkans is off most investors' maps. And the 3-5 year timeline to EU enlargement is too long for typical venture patience.

But for Europe, this investment pays dividends: stronger rule of law in candidate countries, fair markets for SMEs, and billions in procurement savings.

**[VISUAL: Use of funds breakdown]**

Your funding will advance our corruption detection algorithms from TRL 6 to TRL 8, deploy across five countries, and onboard 3,000 paying customers."

---

## 2:45 - 3:00 | CLOSE: Vision & Call to Action

**[VISUAL: Citizens, journalists, business owners benefiting. Final slide with logo and tagline]**

**SPEAKER:**

"Every euro saved from corruption is a euro spent on schools, hospitals, roads.

Every company that wins on merit strengthens the economy.

Every transparency tool brings the Western Balkans closer to Europe.

NabavkiData. Transparency through technology. Opportunity through data. Justice through intelligence.

Join us."

## Alternative Opening (If More Drama Needed)

**[VISUAL: News footage of corruption scandal, documents being shredded]**

**SPEAKER:**

"In 2023, a single procurement scandal in Macedonia cost taxpayers 50 million euros. The documents were there. The patterns were obvious. But no one could see them - because no one could read them.

We built the AI that reads what humans can't."
